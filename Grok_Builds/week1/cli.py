======
A command-line interface (CLI) for the Healthcare Sales Qualifying Questions Generator.

This script lets you generate questions by running the script from the terminal,
using the same agent and prompts as the Streamlit app.

How to Run:
-----------
1. Ensure you're in the GROK_AI_AGENT/Grok_Builds/week1 directory.
2. Run: python cli.py "Your client situation here"
   Example: python cli.py "Client is struggling with patient data"
