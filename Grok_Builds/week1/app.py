======
A Streamlit web interface for the Healthcare Sales Qualifying Questions Generator.

This app uses the SimpleAgent class and prompt templates to generate qualifying questions
based on a user-provided client situation. It's designed to be beginner-friendly and reusable.

Author: Bradley Pierce
Date Created: May 10, 2025

How to Run:
-----------
1. Install requirements: `pip install openai streamlit python-dotenv`
2. Set your OpenAI API key in a `.env` file (for local use) or Streamlit secrets (for Streamlit Cloud).
3. Run the app: `streamlit run app.py`
